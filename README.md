Description:
    This code will create a work day schedule for the current day (from 9am - 5pm). The schedule is color coded as follows: hours in the past are grey, the current hour is red, and hours in the future are green. The code will allow an input next to each hour from the user. If the user pushes the save button next to an input it will persist; if not the input will not be saved.
